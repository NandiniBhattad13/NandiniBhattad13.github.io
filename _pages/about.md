Hi, this is Nandini! Welcome to my website and I hope you are stalking me for a reasonable purpose. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Data Science from IIT Kanpur. I am interested in machine learning and AI, particularly their statistical underpinnings. Apart from that if you are a Potter Head I already like you!!
