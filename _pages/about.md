Hi, this is Nandini! Welcome to my website. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Data Science with minors in Machine Learning and Cognitive Science from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur]{https://www.iitk.ac.in}. I am deeply interested in understanding and exploring the statistical underpinnings of machine learning and artificial intelligence. At IITK, I am currently working with [Prof. Dootika Vats]{https://dvats.github.io} on Markov Chain monte Carlo methods in Reinforcement Learning. I am also collaborating with [Prof. Soumyarup Sadhukhan]{https://sites.google.com/view/soumyarups} on the top trading cycle mechanism in game theory. 
  
Apart from academics, I have served as a Coordinator for the [English Literary Society at IIT Kanpur]{https://elsiitk.wordpress.com} where I was responsible for organizing literary events on campus. I enjoy swimming and I am a trained classical dancer. I am a big fan of the show <em>Friends</em> and if you are a Potterhead, I already like you!
